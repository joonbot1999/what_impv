# WHY?

idk, I just wanted to make sth for fun

It supports pretty much every functionality. I recently changed the image processing to make it faster because base64 url of an image is insanely long, bloating the memory. 

It is scalable thanks to Firestore, and messages that are 100 days old are deleted for privacy.
